Project Abstract:

This project aims to create an application that allows travelers to deliver items or packages on behalf of others while they are traveling from Chennai to Bangalore. Travelers can update their travel details, including the source, destination, date and time of departure and arrival, in the application. If someone wants to deliver an item or package to the destination that the traveler is going to, they can contact the traveler and transfer the items to be delivered in the destination without depending on a courier company. The traveler can also charge a small fee for delivering the courier. The application will have three modules: Admin, Traveler, and Courier. The Traveler module allows travelers to update their travel details and search for delivery opportunities. The Courier module enables individuals who need to deliver items to update their details and package details, and search for travelers to deliver their packages. The Admin module allows the admin to view, verify, and validate the details of travelers and couriers, and delete false entries and expired details.
